"""OCR evaluation -- ``ke``'s first concrete instance, built on ``ocracy``.

OCR is the noisiest special case of information extraction. This subpackage adds
the OCR-specific pieces on top of ``ke``'s source-agnostic core:

- :func:`ocracy_backend` / :func:`read_text` -- a thin bridge that turns
  ``ocracy``'s 16-engine fleet into an ``image -> OcrResult`` callable. The
  dependency arrow is strict: ``ke -> ocracy`` (via the ``ke[ocr]`` extra), never
  the reverse. ``ke`` core depends only on the ``OcrResult`` *shape* (``.text`` /
  ``.blocks`` / ``.mean_confidence``), so the benchmark below evaluates *any*
  ``image -> OcrResult`` callable -- ``ocracy`` or your own.
- :func:`profile` -- per-engine capability profiles (who emits real vs
  model-guessed geometry, who is calibrated, who yields table structure), distilled
  from ``misc/docs/ke_01``. ``ke`` treats these as claims to verify empirically.
- :func:`evaluate_ocr` / :func:`add_gold_item` -- run a fleet over a gold corpus,
  score with CER/WER (globally accumulated), slice the report, and persist gold +
  results to the ``dol`` stores under ``~/.local/share/ke/``.

Heavy engine SDKs and credentials are never required to import this module; they
are checked at call time via :func:`ke.registry.check_requirements`.
