"""Field-level metric for record / dict-shaped extractions.

Compares two flat records key by key into precision / recall / F1, with a wrong
value counting as both a spurious prediction and a missed gold (the conventional
slot-error accounting). It is dependency-free, so it ships in core for the common
"compare these two extracted records" case; the tag-sequence span metrics
(``seqeval`` / ``nervaluate``, with their *explicit* match schemes) and nested
metrics (ANLS*) arrive behind the ``[metrics]`` extra -- see ``misc/docs/ke_02``.

Aggregation is micro-averaged over the corpus (sum TP/FP/FN, then divide), carried
in each :class:`~ke.base.Score`'s ``detail`` so :func:`~ke.facade.evaluate` does it
correctly rather than averaging per-record F1s.
